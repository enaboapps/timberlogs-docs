title: Log Levels
description: Understanding log level severity hierarchy and when to use each level in Timberlogs.
---

Log levels indicate the severity of an event. Timberlogs supports four levels, ordered from least to most severe:

```
debug < info < warn < error
```

## Severity Hierarchy

| Level | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `debug` | Detailed diagnostic information for development and troubleshooting | SQL queries, cache lookups, internal state |
| `info` | Normal operational events and business milestones | User sign-ins, orders placed, jobs completed |
| `warn` | Potential issues that don't block execution but need attention | Rate limits approaching, deprecated API usage, retry attempts |
| `error` | Failures that require immediate investigation | Database connection failures, payment processing errors, unhandled exceptions |

## When to Use Each Level

### debug

Use for information only needed during active debugging. These logs are typically high-volume and disabled in production:

- Database query details and timing
- Cache hit/miss events
- Internal function entry/exit
- Configuration values at startup

### info

Use for events that confirm the system is working correctly. These form the baseline of operational visibility:

- User actions (sign-in, sign-out, purchase)
- Job or request completion
- Service startup and shutdown
- Scheduled task execution

### warn

Use when something unexpected happens but the system can continue. Warnings often indicate future problems:

- Rate limits nearing capacity
- Fallback behavior triggered
- Deprecated feature usage
- Slow operations exceeding thresholds

### error

Use for failures that need attention. Errors mean something went wrong and likely needs a fix:

- Unhandled exceptions
- External service failures
- Data validation errors in critical paths
- Resource exhaustion (disk, memory, connections)

## Level Filtering

You can set a minimum log level to control which logs are sent. When `minLevel` is set, only logs at that level or higher are transmitted:

| minLevel | Sends |
|----------|-------|
| `debug` | debug, info, warn, error |
| `info` | info, warn, error |
| `warn` | warn, error |
| `error` | error only |

This is useful for reducing noise in production while keeping full verbosity in development.

## Dashboard Colors

In the Timberlogs dashboard, each level is color-coded for quick visual scanning:

| Level | Color |
|-------|-------|
| `debug` | Gray |
| `info` | Blue |
| `warn` | Yellow |
| `error` | Red |
