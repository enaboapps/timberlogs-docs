## Error Responses

| Status | Error Message | Endpoint | Resolution |
|--------|--------------|----------|------------|
| 400 | Validation error | [POST /v1/logs](/api-reference/ingestion) | Check the `issues` array for details. Common causes: invalid `level` value, missing required fields, or exceeding the 100-log batch limit. |
| 400 | Search query must be at least 2 characters | [GET /v1/logs/search](/api-reference/search) | The `q` parameter must be at least 2 characters long. Provide a longer search query. |
| 401 | Missing API key | All endpoints | Include the `Authorization` or `X-API-Key` header in your request. See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication). |
| 401 | Invalid API key | All endpoints | Verify the key format (`tb_live_*` / `tb_test_*`) and that it was copied correctly. Generate a new key if needed. |
| 401 | API key has been revoked | All endpoints | This key has been revoked. Create a new key in **Settings > API Keys**. |
| 401 | API key has expired | All endpoints | This key has expired. Create a new key in **Settings > API Keys**. |
| 403 | Access denied to organization | All endpoints | The API key does not have access to the specified organization. Verify the key belongs to the correct org. |
| 403 | User has no organization | All endpoints | Create or join an organization in the [dashboard](https://app.timberlogs.dev). |
| 404 | Log not found | [GET /v1/logs/:id](/api-reference/query) | The log ID doesn't exist or belongs to a different organization. Verify the ID and API key. |
| 404 | Organization not found | All endpoints | Double-check the `organizationId` value in your request. |
| 429 | Rate limit exceeded | [POST /v1/logs](/api-reference/ingestion) | Wait `retryAfter` seconds before retrying. Batch logs into fewer requests or upgrade your plan. |
| 500 | Search failed | [GET /v1/logs/search](/api-reference/search) | Retry the request. If it persists, simplify the query or reduce search fields. |

Validation errors include additional detail:

  "issues": [
    {
      "path": ["logs", 0, "level"],
      "message": "Invalid enum value"
