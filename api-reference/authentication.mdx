description: API key authentication for the Timberlogs API.
---

Timberlogs uses API Keys for authentication.

## API Keys

API keys are the recommended method for server-side applications and SDKs.

### Key Format

API keys follow the format: `tb_{environment}_{random}`

- `tb_live_*` - Production keys
- `tb_test_*` - Test/development keys

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://timberlogs-ingest.enaboapps.workers.dev/v1/logs \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tb_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"logs": [...]}'
```

Or use the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://timberlogs-ingest.enaboapps.workers.dev/v1/logs \
  -H "X-API-Key: tb_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"logs": [...]}'
```

### Creating API Keys

1. Sign in to [app.timberlogs.dev](https://app.timberlogs.dev)
2. Select your organization
3. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
4. Click **Create API Key**
5. Store the key securely - it's only shown once

### Key Security

- Keys are hashed before storage (we never store the raw key)
- Use environment variables to store keys in your applications
- Rotate keys periodically
- Revoke compromised keys immediately

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "error": "Missing API key"
}
```

**How to resolve:** Check that the `Authorization` or `X-API-Key` header is included in your request.

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

**How to resolve:** Verify the key format (`tb_live_*` / `tb_test_*`) and that it was copied correctly. If in doubt, generate a new key in **Settings > API Keys**.

```json
{
  "error": "API key has been revoked"
}
```

**How to resolve:** This key has been revoked and can no longer be used. Create a new key in the dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.

```json
{
  "error": "API key has expired"
}
```

**How to resolve:** This key has expired. Create a new key in the dashboard under **Settings > API Keys**.

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "error": "Access denied to organization"
}
```

**How to resolve:** The API key does not have access to the specified organization. Verify the key belongs to the correct organization.

```json
{
  "error": "User has no organization"
}
```

**How to resolve:** The account associated with this request has no organization. Create or join an organization in the dashboard.

### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "error": "Organization not found"
}
```

**How to resolve:** The organization ID doesn't exist. Double-check the `organizationId` value in your request.

## Best Practices

1. **Store keys securely** - Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Use different keys per environment** - Separate test and production keys
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Especially after team changes
4. **Revoke compromised keys immediately** - Generate a new key in the dashboard
