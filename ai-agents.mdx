title: AI Agent Integration
description: Make your AI coding agent aware of Timberlogs with one command.
---

Timberlogs documentation is discoverable by 40+ AI coding agents via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh). Once installed, your agent knows how to set up Timberlogs, send logs, query data, and use the CLI.

## Install the skill

Run this in your project directory:

```bash
npx skills add https://docs.timberlogs.dev
```

The CLI auto-detects your installed agents and lets you choose which ones to configure.

## Supported agents

The Timberlogs skill works with any agent that supports the skills.sh standard, including:

- **Claude Code**
- **Cursor**
- **GitHub Copilot**
- **Windsurf**
- **Gemini CLI**
- **Codex**
- **OpenCode**
- **Amp**
- And 30+ more

## What the skill provides

Once installed, your AI agent can:

- Set up Timberlogs in your project with the correct SDK and configuration
- Send structured logs using the right API format
- Query and search logs via the REST API or CLI
- Track flows across multi-step operations
- Follow best practices like flushing before exit and storing API keys in environment variables

## Custom skill

The skill file is auto-generated from the documentation and updated on every deploy. You can view it directly at [docs.timberlogs.dev/skill.md](https://docs.timberlogs.dev/skill.md).
