The Logs view is the primary interface for exploring your application logs in real-time.

## Log List

The main logs view displays logs in reverse chronological order (newest first).

### Log Row

Each log row shows:
- **Timestamp** - When the log was created
- **Level** - Color-coded badge (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Source** - Application or service name
- **Message** - Log message (truncated)

### Level Colors

Each log level is color-coded for quick scanning. See [Log Levels](/concepts/log-levels#dashboard-colors) for the full color reference.

## Filtering

### Level Filter

Click the level dropdown to filter by log level:
- **All** - Show all levels
- **debug** - Debug logs only
- **info** - Info and above
- **warn** - Warnings and errors
- **error** - Errors only

### Source Filter

Type or select a source to filter logs from a specific service:

```
api-server
worker
frontend
```

### Environment Filter

Filter by deployment environment:
- development
- staging
- production

### Time Range

Set a custom date range using the **from** and **to** datetime pickers.

## Search

Use the search bar to find logs by content.

### Basic Search

Type keywords to find matching logs:

```
payment error
```

### Phrase Search

Use quotes for exact phrases:

```
"database connection failed"
```

### Exclude Terms

Prefix with `-` to exclude:

```
error -debug
```

### OR Queries

Use `OR` between terms:

```
timeout OR refused
```

## Log Detail View

Click any log row to expand it and see full details.

### Fields Displayed

}
```

## Tips

### Debugging Issues

1. Filter to `error` level
2. Set appropriate time range
3. Search for relevant keywords
4. Expand logs to see stack traces
5. Use request/session IDs for correlation

### Monitoring

1. Keep the view on `error` or `warn`
2. Set source filter to critical services
3. Use flows for multi-step operations

### Performance Analysis

1. Search for "slow" or "timeout"
2. Look at `data` field for timing info
3. Group by source to find problematic services
